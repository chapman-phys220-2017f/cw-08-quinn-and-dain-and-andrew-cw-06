## Specification

The main task this week is to make sure you are caught up on all your work, and to focus on completing your midterm.

1. Work through the notebook of examples, as a gallery of other useful python features.

## Assessment

Analyze in this section what you found useful about this assignment in your own words. Include any lingering questions or comments that you may have.

Sympi looks like it can be incredibly helpful! It's going to make life really easy. Hopefully documentation is as good as numpy.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,

**Quinn Gates**
